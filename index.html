      <p>One of the most frequently asked questions by people interested in learning programming is what language should they start off with. The short answer is that the most important thing you can learn in Computer Science is logic statements and how programming languages work in general. That still leaves open the question of which language is better to start with first.</p>

      <p>This is a short quiz to help you decide what type of language is a good jumping off point for you. Not just what type of language will benefit you most, but also what languages will likely make the most sense to your style of thinking.</p>

      <p>One important thing to note is that even after you learn a language, there is a good chance that you will have reasons to learn several more languages. An employer might be starting a new project in another language or they might have a long running program that uses several languages at once.</p>

      <p class="col-md-6">One thing that affect your language preference the most is whether you want to deal with slick and easy to use design, or if you prefer to concentrate on logic of a program more. In the end you will likely need to use a little of both, but it's good to start with where your mind naturally starts on a problem.</p>
