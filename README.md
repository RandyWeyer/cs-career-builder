## Description

_A website that helps students decide what type of language they would prefer or be good at._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone or download the repository._
* _If downloaded, unzip the files into a single directory._
* _Right-click on the HTML file "index.html", then open it using a web browser._
* _Use Firefox or Chrome for best results, though IE shouldn't have any problems._

## Known Bugs

_Due to the use of bootstrap columns the website will look distorted on small resolutions. This is because bootstrap collapses all columns to take the entire width of the parent element on small resolutions. I might end up using a table based on the current layout._
